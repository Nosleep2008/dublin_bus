# COMP47360-Research Practicum (MSc Conv)-2019/20 Summer

## Background

Bus companies produce schedules which contain generic travel times. There are many variables which determine how long the actual journey will take.  Traffic conditions which are affected by the time of day, the day of the week, the month of the year and the weather play an important role in determining how long the journey will take.  

This project involves analyzing historic Dublin Bus data and weather data in order to create dynamic travel time estimates. Based on data analysis of historic Dublin Bus data, a system which when presented with any bus route, departure time, the day of the week, current weather condition, produces an accurate estimate of travel time for the complete route and sections of the route.  

This system can produce and display via the interface an accurate estimate of travel time for the selected journey, which is based on real-time. This project can provide more accurate time for users' journey.
